Overview
--------

15.020 Competition in Telecommunications provides an introduction to the economics, business strategies, and technology of telecommunications markets, including markets for wireless communications, local and long-distance services, and telecommunications customer equipment. The convergence of computers, cable TV and telecommunications and the competitive emergence of the Internet are covered in depth. The shifting roles of technology, Federal and state government policies, and business strategies in shaping these rapidly changing markets are studied, with particular emphasis on the roles of regulation and competition and the likely evolution of technology, public policy, and market structures over the next decade. A number of speakers from leading companies in the industry will give course lectures. Students have the opportunity to meet and have dinner with the speakers.

### Course Readings

Most of the readings for the course are available for free online (on the class server or on external websites). Some of the articles and papers may require minimal online payments (ex. on _The Economist_ or _Harvard Business Review_ websites). Rather than assembling a course packet and make students pay for all readings, including optional ones, we opted for giving you the option to purchase only the documents you intend on reading.

The _optional_ (but recommended) text for this course is Annabel Dodd's, _The Essential Guide to Telecommunications_, 3rd ed. This text is available at the campus bookstore, and can be found on reserve at the library. This text introduces technologies relevant to the telecommunications marketplace, and is strongly recommended for students that are new to the industry. Other texts will be kept on reserve at the library are:

*   _Newton's Telecom Dictionary_ by Harry Newton and Ray Horak is an industry classic that helps readers understand many technologies and acronyms.
*   Steve Rosenbush from _USA Today_ published _Telecom Business Opportunities_ which contains many interesting anecdotes about firms in their early years.

Course Dinners
--------------

We intend to arrange dinners with as many speakers as possible, to allow small numbers of students to meet with key leaders in the telecommunications industry in an informal environment on the evening of the lecture.
